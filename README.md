This repository contains documents from my research project on network science with Prof. Bianconi from Queen Mary Uniervsity, prior to starting university. 

I simulated synthetic and real-world networks (protein-protein interaction networks, gene regulation networks, airport networks, etc.) confirming existing 
theoretical predictions, as well as exploring my own research questions.

The report describing my simulations, findings and explorations can be found in **networkORIS.pdf**.
